# IIIFStack
### AWS CloudFormation Stack Template for building a serverless implementation of the International Image Interoperability Framework
### The API specification is from the [version 2.1 IIIF image API available here](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/)

At present, this demonstration stack for CloudFormation only implements a bare minimum selection of the IIIF Image API functions, has no error handling, and no authentication.  It therefore cannot be used as a working target for an IIIF client software at this time, and is exclusively a work in progress.
